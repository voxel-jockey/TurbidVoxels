# TurbidVoxels

Greetings, Turbidity fans.

  Modelling light's behaviour in a turbid nonuniform medium represented by voxels.

  The light comes down from above, in the middle. The scale is big enough to be classical physics not quantum.  The energy levels are also classical not small anough to get near Plancks constant or to become quantised.

  Our medium does not yet move and comprises a cube made of cubic voxels or abitrary size with optical properties such as refraction, fluoresence.  Fluorescence cbe in various wavelengths informed by the stuff that is in the voxels.  So can absorption of light. 

  Please write your own tests, type de;lcarations and timings as you go and try to to follow the house style.  We constrain the size of the sides of the cubes of the medium to be of Mersenne number length - tey scale well and are always odd so the beam never starts on a crack.  Dont worry about refractive patterns of interference between adjacent lumenscent voxels this is a synchrotron wave.

  The beam has notionally zero width but also has a Gaussian distribution if you look closely.

  The aim is to model the intensity of light at eight sensibly placed non-directional light sensors (with perfect spectral sensitivity) in the 3D space around the big cube of turbid medium. Like at the crdinal points or the 8 points of a cube. Facing "in" if it matters.

  Welcome, and have fun.

  May all your paths be straight and bright, 

  yours,
